available_courses: given what I've taken so far, what courses are available for me to take next? 
(i.e. what courses have I satisfied the prerequisites for?)
in:
- list of courses taken so far
out:
- list of courses i can take
implementation details: 
- iterate through all courses in dataset and check if prerequisites are satisfied (using is_requirements_satisfied) 
and course is not in input list. if so, add to output list

is_requirements_satisifed: given a list of courses taken, have I satisfied a given requirement?
in:
- requirement (ex. security course requirement)
- list of courses taken
out:
- boolean
implementation details:
- call corresponding helper function for a type of requirement

all_cs_requirements_satisfied: given a list of courses taken, have I satisfied all requirements for CS curriculum?
in:
- list of courses taken
out:
- boolean

create_graph: given a list of available courses, create a graph with all possible paths
in:
- list of available courses (ex. during first year, only classes like CS1800 are available)
- list of courses taken so far
out:
- parent node of graph
impl details:
-  recursively call create_graph on each child node (i.e. each course in the list of available courses) and create edge between parent node 
and return value of create_graph
- ^ update available courses accordingly (i.e. remove course that was just taken from list of available courses and add courses 
that are now available)
- ^ update courses taken so far accordingly (i.e. add course that was just taken to list of courses taken so far)
- base case is all_cs_requirements_satisfied is true given taken_so_far, return parent node

main function: call create_graph with input as CS 1800 (assume we take this first to make it easier for ourselves with jsut 1 parent node) and 
list of courses taken so far as empty list


notes: 
- ignore co-requisites for now to make it easier?
- a "requirement" can be defined as the set of pre-requisites for a course or a set of courses (like CS fundamental coures) - we can 
break down the logic for each requirement into separate functions. Example usage - is_requirements_satisfied("CS fundamental courses", courses_taken), 
is_requirements_satisfied("pre-reqs for CS 3000", courses_taken)
